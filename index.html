Happy Anniversary Mike and Ramona! 
<br>Mike, you married up! Ramona is such an outstanding mother and friend to so many- truly a treasure :):):)
<br> Ramona, you married a wonderful, honorable,stand up guy (but don't tell him 'Squealy' said so - it might go to his Mighty Mike, Lord High Ruler of the Metroplex head [wink]). Here's to the next 30 years.
<br>Love, Michaele, Kirk, Rachel, Hugh and The Twins! 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Mike and Ramona, 
<br>What started at the Blenheim Slime in Lubbock, Texas has turned out to be a loving, strong and devoted marriage.
<br>You've come a long way from Lubbock and Beaumont to build your family and life in Dallas and at the ranch. You have accomplished so much together. 
<br> Wishing you the best in the days and years ahead. We hope to spend more time with you in the future.
<br> Congratulations and Happy Anniversary!
<br> -Susan and Robb

<br>LOVE is the virtue of the HEART, 
<br>SINCERITY, the virtue of the MIND,
<br>COURAGE, the virtue of the SPIRIT,
<br>DECISION, the virtue of the WILL
<br> -- Frank Lloyd Wright, 1940 --
<br>
<br>To Ramona and Mike on celebrating 29 great years together,
<br>standing by one another, raising a wonderful family filled with LOVE, SINCERITY, COURAGE and bold DECISIONS.  You have risen to all the challenges 
<br>that are now mere memories, and stand ready for the future no matter what!  
<br>Congratulations and best wishes for the next 29 plus! 
<br>Love, Linda and Eddie.
