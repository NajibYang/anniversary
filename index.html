Happy Anniversary Mike and Ramona! 
<br>Mike, you married up! Ramona is such an outstanding mother and friend to so many- truly a treasure :):):)
<br> Ramona, you married a wonderful, honorable,stand up guy (but don't tell him 'Squealy' said so - it might go to his Mighty Mike, Lord High Ruler of the Metroplex head [wink]). Here's to the next 30 years.
<br>Love, Michaele, Kirk, Rachel, Hugh and The Twins! 
<br>
<br>
<br>Mike and Ramona, 
<br>What started at the Blenheim Slime in Lubbock, Texas has turned out to be a loving, strong and devoted marriage.
<br>You've come a long way from Lubbock and Beaumont to build your family and life in Dallas and at the ranch. You have accomplished so much together. 
<br> Wishing you the best in the days and years ahead. We hope to spend more time with you in the future.
<br> Congratulations and Happy Anniversary!
<br> -Susan and Robb

<br>LOVE is the virtue of the HEART, 
<br>SINCERITY, the virtue of the MIND,
<br>COURAGE, the virtue of the SPIRIT,
<br>DECISION, the virtue of the WILL
<br> -- Frank Lloyd Wright, 1940 --
<br>
<br>To Ramona and Mike on celebrating 29 great years together,
<br>standing by one another, raising a wonderful family filled with LOVE, SINCERITY, COURAGE and bold DECISIONS.  You have risen to all the challenges 
<br>that are now mere memories, and stand ready for the future no matter what!  
<br>Congratulations and best wishes for the next 29 plus! 
<br>Love, Linda and Eddie.

Congratulations, Mike and Ramona, on your 29th anniversary! 
<br>You have created a beautiful, successful family, with three children who believe in themselves, their own path, yet are secure enough to appreciate their solid home base.  
<br>You've also opened your home, hearts and family to a couple of boys who truly view themselves as your kids, and whom you have allowed to treat your homes as theirs, 
<br>giving them safe haven to grow away from home but still be "home".  They brought their own families to you, whom you have also accepted as part of yours, for which we are ever delighted and thankful.  
<br>You've made a beautiful life together, and we hope you are celebrating how far you've come and what's around the corner.  
<br>Much love from the In-Laws - Pat and Al

<br>

"Happy anniversary! Looking back on what has been an awesome adventure, I wish you guys nothing but the best for the future to come!"
